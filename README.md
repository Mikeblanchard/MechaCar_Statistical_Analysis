# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

The purposse of this analysis was to use statistical methods to look at vehicle performance, with the intent of designing an efficient prototype. Special consideration was paid to vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, All Wheel Drive capabilities, Miles per Gallon of gas consumption and Pounds per Square Inch of suspension coil pressure. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- As non-random variables have a variance of 0, we can determine that the intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance are non-random 


Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
